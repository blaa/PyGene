Changelog for pygene

December 12, 2005

    - version 0.2.1

        - renamed Organism class to MendelOrganism, to indicate
          that it is based on a 'double-helix' eukaryotic model
        - created Organism class, which uses only single helix
          (single genes, not gene pairs)

December 11, 2005

    - version 0.2
        - added genetic programming!!
            - with working example
        - changed mutation behaviour
            - previously, child organisms were mutated in-place
            - now, .mutate() on organisms returns a mutated copy
        - changed crossover behaviour
            - previously, crossover mating only returned one child
            - now, crossover mating returns 2 children, so no
              genetic material is lost

          populations
        - added 'incest' feature, where high-fitness parents

          children
